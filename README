This program is not ready for useage.
This is made in Dr. Racket (a newer version of Dr. Scheme), a derivitive of Lisp.
To run this program (once it is ready), you must just download everything, and then open up Crazy-Chess.rkt in Dr.Racket, and click 'run' in the top left corner of the screen.

Rules of the game to be:
All pieces move the same way as in orthodox chess
Every turn the player may chose to move 1 piece and one piece only per turn
Players may chose where to place their pieces one the starting blocks.
The goal of the game is to have both enemy teams defeated
The pawns cannot attack over the far corners of the board (C3, C10, K3, KI10), where the red dot is.
Defeat rules:
  A) Once a king is checkmated, the king's team is defeated
	B) When a team is defeated, the pieces stay were they are, cannot be moved, and can only be removed by the opposing team taking the pieces, by landing on them
	C) However, the king is removed from the chessboard when a team is captured
	D) Even though they may not move, defeated pieces still can be used to block the king's movement (eg. if there is a tower guarding all of row 6, the king may not go onto row 6)
